<h2 id="Swimming">Swimming</h2>
<p>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water.
  The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake).
  Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports,
   with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
   In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay.
   A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.

Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition,
there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.
There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps,
jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.
 Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport,
 such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport. </p>

 <h3>Swim styles</h3>

 <p>In competitive swimming, four major styles have been established.
 These have been relatively stable over the last 30â€“40 years with minor improvements.</p>
 <p>They are:</p>
<ol>
     <li>Butterfly</li>
     <li>Backstroke</li>
     <li>Breaststroke</li>
     <li>Freestyle</li>
 </ol>

<h2 id="Cycling">Cycling</h2>
<p>Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.
   People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers".
    Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles,
    quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.
 They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.

Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[
 optimal for short to moderate distances.

Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles,
including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking,
 increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails.
 Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution,
  and much reduced traffic congestion.
  These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large
  (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).
  By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses,
   transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.

In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers,
heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.
 Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries,
  particularly after hip surgery.
   Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements,
   including less perceived stress and better vitality.

Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles
 (excepting tricycles or quadracycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright,
  the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles,
   often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas),
   vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers,
   and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances. </p>

<h2 id="Street workout">Street workout</h2>
<p>Street workout is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities.
   It became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe,
    and the United States, especially in New York City, Baltimore's urban neighborhoods,
    Myanmar, and Morocco. It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of athletics, calisthenics, and sports.
    Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks.
    There are also street workout teams and organized competitions exercises
     such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats.
     Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.

Street workout is divided in two main branches,
the first one being strength training and the second dynamics.
Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc.
Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others.
Dynamics includes movements like 360s and its variations, switchblades,
 and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets.

<h2 id="Running">Running</h2>

<p>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.
  Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).
   This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground,
    the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance
    leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.
     A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics
     is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously,
      with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.
       The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.

Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.

It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability
to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals.
 Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.
 Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE,
  while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE.
Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.</p>
