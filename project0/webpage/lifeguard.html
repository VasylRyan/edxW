          A lifeguard is present where people are swimming in order to be of assistance during an emergency and make sure that people swim and enjoy themselves in a safe and sensible fashion. Lifeguards are essential in all situations where large numbers of the public go to swim, be it in a swimming pool or at a popular beach. Water can be deadly and lifeguards are lifesavers who can rescue and resuscitate people that otherwise would have drowned. Both men and women populate the profession in equal measure although in the conditions of a particularly dangerous beach there may be more male lifeguards than female, owing to the strength required to rescue a full grown man from strong currents. The work comes with its own set of dangers, as people when drowning quite often panic and in this state they present a mortal danger to whoever is trying to rescue them. In the beach situation there can be the added dangers of poisonous or predatory sea life, strong currents and underwater obstacles such as rocks and sharp coral reefs. In a beach situation lifeguards use surfboards, body boards, inflatable dinghies and even jet skis and quad bikes to reach those in danger as quickly as possible. In a pool side situation, little flotation assistance is required other than an inflatable stretcher for transporting people who have suffered spinal injuries in the water.
        <h2 id="Salary">Salary</h2>
        Pool lifeguards earn between £11,000 and £20,000 per annum, or work on an hourly rate of £5 - £10 per hour, depending on the place they are working. It is common for lifeguards to increase their income by taking additional qualifications as swimming coach, personal trainer, fitness coach etc.

        <h2 id="Responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
        Pool side and beach lifeguards have different responsibilities: Pool side lifeguards:

        Ensuring that swimmers behave in a safe fashion; this means enforcing rules relating to pool side conduct.
        Removing a distressed swimmer from the water and resuscitating them if necessary at pool side.
        Testing and regulating water temperature, PH levels, chlorine and hygiene.
        Administering basic first aid for cuts and bruises.

        Beach lifeguards:

        Identifying and demarcating danger spots as no-swim areas.
        Rescuing swimmers in danger and removing them from the area.
        Rescuing drowning swimmers, and resuscitating them when back on dry land (or in the water in special cases).
        Providing constant vigilant watch over large areas of the beach.
        Providing advice on where to swim, surf or engage in other water sports.
        Administering basic first aid for cuts, bruises or stings.


        <h2 id="Qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
        To qualify as a lifeguard you must be physically fit and a strong, competent swimmer; you must be over 16 years of age and over 18 for beach lifeguards. Additionally lifeguards must have one of the following qualifications (lifeguarding qualifications are valid for 2 years only, at which point they must be re-assessed). Pool lifeguards:

        National Pool Lifeguard Qualification (NPLQ); this is awarded by the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS).
        National Rescue Standard (NarRS) up to STA Level 2 - Pool Lifeguard; this is awarded by the Swimming Teachers Association (STA).

        Beach lifeguards:

        National Beach Lifeguard Qualification (NBLQ); this is awarded by the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS).
        National Rescue Standard (NarRS) qualification up to STA Level 2 Certificate - Beach Lifeguard; this is awarded by the Swimming Teachers Association (STA).

        To qualify as a beach lifeguard you can attend a private course or join a local lifeguard club as a volunteer. Once qualified you can work with the RNLI. However, the RNLI has a further set of more stringent qualifying conditions and you must be able to complete the following under live test conditions. Lifeguard In a pool

        400 metre pool swim in 7.5 mins.
        200 metre swim in 3.5 mins.
        25 metre pool swim under the water, then immediately after a 25 metre normal swim in 50 secs.

        On the beach

        200 metre run in 40 secs.

        <h2 id="Skills">Skills</h2>
        In addition to the fitness, qualifications and swimming abilities required to be a lifeguard, the following would also be useful:

        Ability to inspire confidence and calm in the face of a crisis.
        Ability to enforce swimming pool rules in a considerate but firm manner.
        Good eyesight.
        Excellent powers of concentration; lifeguards must remain alert.
        Ability to react quickly and efficiently in a life threatening situation.

        <h2 id="Working Conditions">Working Conditions</h2>
        Beach lifeguards usually only work in daylight hours. Pool lifeguards meanwhile usually work on a shift basis; pool opening times are normally from around 7 in the morning to 10 at night, 7 days a week including public holidays except for Christmas and New Year. On a day to day basis (excluding a rare emergency situation) the job is not physically demanding but because of the level of vigilance required it can be quite mentally demanding.

        <h2 id="Experience">Experience</h2>
        Experience as a Pool or Leisure Centre Assistant can be useful to become a lifeguard. Any experience dealing directly with the public in a face to face role, such as retail, or sports coaching may also be beneficial. However, no experience is officially required beyond the legal qualifications and fitness minimums laid out in the qualifications section.

        <h2 id="Employers">Employers</h2>

        Leisure centres are by far the biggest employers of lifeguards; these may be run by local councils or by private enterprise.
        Private gyms, schools and hotels also employ lifeguards.
        Beach lifeguards are often volunteers working for the RNLI.


        <h2 id="Career Progression">Career Progression</h2>
        The Swimming Teachers Association (STA) also runs courses for Pool Side Attendants and Pool Side Helpers. Once employed in either of these posts you can take another course to qualify as a lifeguard while working. Working within a leisure centre there may be opportunities to take management courses and so progress to being a supervisor or leisure centre manager. In terms of career progression both the NaRS and NPLQ count towards a level 2 NVQ in Sport and Recreation. This can lead onto to other sports qualifications such as Personal Instructor, Fitness Coach and many others.
