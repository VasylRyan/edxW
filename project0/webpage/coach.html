      Swimming coaches help swimmers of different ability levels to improve their technique, fitness and performance in the water using a range of exercises, and fitness and dietary programmes. Being a swimming coach involves a range of activities. Common tasks would include:

          Attending training sessions with groups or individuals
          Keeping up-to-date on developments in sports science
          Advising clients on technique and performance
          Developing training routines for swimmers
          Demonstrating strokes and styles in the pool
          Advising on diet and fitness
          Attending competitive functions with athletes
          Collecting equipment at the end of sessions
          Managing private business accounts
          Completing tax returns
          Expanding a client base through marketing and advertising

          <h2 id="Salary">Salary</h2>


      <p>As swimming coaching, like almost all coaching jobs,
        is based on an hourly rate for clients, this means that most independent coaches'
         earnings vary depending on the number of clients on the books and the number of hours'
         training completed. The hourly wage is often good, rising from £15 up to as much as £60 or more,
         dependant on qualifications and experience, but earnings are flexible and potentially
         unreliable as a result. Some coaches are employed by leisure centres,
         gyms or swimming pools on a full time basis, providing more stable employment,
         with salaries ranging from £15k to much more for better-qualified individuals.</p>
      <h2 id="Responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
      Swimming coaches have the job of helping people to swim faster and better, and sometimes even teaching adults or children from scratch. Often clients will come to a coach with a range of objectives or requirements and the coach will help them to plan a programme of exercise, often including dietary and non-swimming fitness elements. The coach will then help the client to meet their objectives over a given period of time, providing motivation, encouragement and advice along the way. Sometimes duties will involve training children or adults as competitive athletes, sometimes as part of a club or team, advising on race technique and timing in order to maximize an individual swimmer’s performance.
      <h2 id="Qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
      Qualifications are an important aspect which should be taken seriously as a swimming coach. There is a range of formal qualifications and different stages to complete, but many coaches have also been competitive swimmers themselves when young, something which is an advantage when proving credentials and expertise. The most common progression is to do the British Amateur Swimming Association qualification. Level 1 confers assistant teacher level, and Level 2 confers full teacher status. Above this, it is also possible to become a club coach.
      <h2 id="Skills">Skills</h2>
      Being a swimming coach requires a range of skills, including:

          Excellent knowledge of swimming and good swimming ability
          Patience and good people-skills
          Flexibility to meet changing demands
          Good organisational skills to juggle different clients
          Good instinct for publicising services
          The ability to manage a network of clients

      <h2 id="Working Conditions">Working Conditions</h2>
      Swimming coaches spend most of the time at the swimming pool, though not usually in the water. This means the working conditions are fairly safe and warm, if not overly active, for much of the time actual coaching is taking place.
      <h2 id="Experience">Experience</h2>
      Actual experience of being a coach is perhaps less important than having the right qualifications, although if you are unqualified you will be expected to have experience of being a professional or competitive swimmer. Many keen swimmers become coaches after they finish competing or reach the peak of their ability, and to be a coach it is important to know about the way in which swimming competitions work, what it is like to compete in them and so on, especially when dealing with athletic swimming.
      <h2 id="Employers">Employers</h2>
      Most swimming coaches are self-employed but a few are employed by teams, clubs or leisure centres on a full-time basis.
      <h2 id="Career Progression">Career Progression</h2>
      Swimming coaches depend on having a wide enough and solid enough client base to provide a consistent income. They must also be able to take on new pupils as old ones drop out. Some coaches start as junior coaches or assistants and the first step beyond this is to become an independent coach with an independent coaching business. Beyond that it is possible to employ assistants or run or set up a swimming school or academy. After this, some coaches graduate to club coach level.
